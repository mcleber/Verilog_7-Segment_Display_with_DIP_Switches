# 7-Segment Display with DIP Switches in Verilog

It is strongly based on the “cistern” example from the book Eletrônica Digital, Verilog e FPGA. 

## Description

This project implements a BCD (Binary-Coded Decimal) converter that reads DIP switch input and controls a 7-segment display, showing digits 0–8 or ‘E’ for invalid combinations. It offers a hands-on introduction to Verilog development and FPGA pin mapping using the Gowin IDE.
